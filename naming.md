# Naming Convention

## Overview

GGUF quantization algorithms follow a systematic(ish) naming convention that helps identify the quantization methodology, as well as gauge the compression rate. Here are some examples:

## 1. The quantization algorithm version
- [Legacy quants](legacy-quants.md): End in `_0` or `_1` (e.g., `Q4_0`, `Q4_1`)
- [K-quants](k-quants.md): Include the letter `K` in the name (e.g., `Q4_K`).
    - Most likely, `K` stands for [Kawrakov](https://github.com/ikawrakow), the name of the developer who implemented them.
    - `K` does NOT stand for [K-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering), which is a common misconception online.
- [I-quants](i-quants.md): Include the letter `I` in the name (e.g., `IQ1`).
    - Most likely, `I` stands for "importance"

## 2. The bit width
The `Q` part tells us the **bit width** - the number of bits used to store (most) weights:

- `Q4` = 4 bpw
- `Q5` = 5 bpw  
- `Q6` = 6 bpw
- `Q8` = 8 bpw

For [I-quants](i-quants.md), the bit widths are approximate:
- `IQ1` = ~1 bpw
- `IQ2` = ~2 bpw
- `IQ3` = ~3 bpw
- `IQ4` = ~4 bpw

This is because I-quants do *vector quantization*, which stores N weights into an M-bit code. The amortized compression rate is N/M bpw, which might not be an integer.



## 3. The size modifier
Currently, LLMs get quantized with *mixed precision*, i.e. not all weights use the same bit widths. Parameters fall in one of three categories:

1. Quantized to the bit width indicated by `Q`;

2. Not quantized / kept in full precision (e.g. token embeddings, [LayerNorm](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LayerNorm.html) weights);

3. Quantized to some middle bit width (hand-picked by the `llama.cpp` authors).

The size modifier in the filename (`S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`) is a rough indication for the precision used for the third category of weights.

For instance, the screenshot below compares `Q4_K_S` (left) against `Q4_K_M` (right); we'll discuss the meaning of `K` below. The parameter `blk.0.attn_v.weight` was quantized to `Q5` in the `S` version (left) and `Q6` in the `M` version (right).
